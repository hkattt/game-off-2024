# Interrogation

## Overview 
Interrogation was made using Godot 4 and GDScript for [GitHub Game Off 2024](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2024). The theme of the game jam was was `SECRETS`. We **almost** followed the `SMALL PALETTE` wildcard, using a colour palette with 6 colours. 

Interrogation is a murder mystery game where you question suspects and piece together the truth to solve a crime.
