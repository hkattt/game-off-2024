Detective, we’ve got a real mess on our hands. Lady [LADY_NAME] is dead—found in her home with no clear explanation. I don’t have much, but we’ve got four people who were close to her, and each of them might know more than they’re letting on.

There’s Kite, the kid who found the body. Then there’s Patricia, the chef, who cooked for her all the time. Dr. Grey, her doctor, had a history with the lady—he’s got a temper. And finally, Professor Vanth, the scientist she was having an affair with.

I’m at my wit’s end here. I need your help to figure out what happened before this case goes cold.
