Detective, we've got a situation. Ms. Grey is dead with no signs of a struggle. Four people were close to her, but one of them is hiding something.

There's Kite, the kid who found her body. Dr. Grey, her husband and our top doctor. Patricia, the chef she often visited. And Professor Vanth, the prodigy scientist said to be close to her. We need answers before this case goes cold.
